# dockerfiles

Here are some Dockerfiles.

## latex

This was forked and extended from [https://gitlab.com/aergus/dockerfiles](gl) and therefore the "latex" Dockerfile
inherits that [CC0 licence](./LICENSE.txt). I've added some modifications to it in order to support my thesis-building
project.

## corretto11

This is a general purpose corretto11 runtime which I use for some private projects.
